# Project Overview

This Fitness Tracker app is a Python-based application designed to help users manage workouts, set fitness goals, and monitor progress in an efficient, structured way. Built as part of a capstone project, it demonstrates the practical application of Python and SQL for real-world fitness management. Users can create custom workout routines, set goals, and log progress across multiple exercise categories.

# Key Features

**Exercise Management:**

- Add, view, and delete workout categories, making it easy to manage multiple exercise types.
- Customise workout routines by selecting specific exercises, reps, and sets.
  
**Goal Setting and Progress Tracking:**

- Set fitness goals based on exercise completion (e.g., number of sets or reps for each workout).
- Track progress toward these goals, gaining valuable insights into achievements and areas for improvement.
  
**Database Integration:**

- Uses SQLite for data persistence, storing workout routines, exercise logs, and goals.
- Modular DatabaseManager simplifies database operations, while components like CategoryManager and ExerciseLogsManager handle data management for specific functions.

**Menu-Driven Command Line Interface:**

- Features an intuitive menu system that lets users easily interact with different sections of the application through simple commands.
